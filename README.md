# BankRobbingAdventure

You and a couple of friends are low on money. You've tried getting a job but no one is hiring. You guys decide that the best option to get money is to rob a bank. You want money and this seems like the best way to get it. After a couple hours of preparation, you guys decide that tonight is the perfect night to do it. After the sun sets and all the shops close down, you and your buddies begin to stake out the bank. When the clock strikes 12:34, it's time to get this show on the road. Let the robbery commence. PRESS START
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

The first decision you guys have to make is how you're going to get into the bank. There are 2 entrances, one in the front and one in the back. There are also windows circling the bank. There are pros and cons to each entrance. Are you going to pick the lock of the front door, smash a window, or blow up the back entrance?

You picked the lock of the front door but the alarm just sounded. You panic. You try to open the door and make your escape but the doors have locked behind you. It's only a matter of time before you and your friends are caught. Your grand plan has failed. The cops are on their way.

You decided to smash the window. After using your hammer and making sure there was no excess glass, you guys climb into the bank. You have successfully made it into the bank. The next question is what to do from there. You could try to disable to cameras, but that may waste some time. The other option is to go straight for the money. What do you want to do?

You decided to disable the cameras. Nice work! After a couple minutes, you successfully stopped them. However, someone driving by saw some kids messing with the cameras and called the cops. They're on their way. What are you going to do with the time you have? You could divide the team up and have some lookout for the cops, or all go for the money.

You guys decided to go straight for the cash. You run for the money and shove as much as you can in to each of your bags. You zip up your duffels and make a run for it. By the time you get out of the vault the cops are waiting for you. They order you to drop the bags and handcuff you all. You are taken down to the station and arrested.

You decided to put one of your buddies on lookout. You enter the fault and begin gathering money. While you guys are collecting the money, your friend radios you to tell you that he sees the police and that you better get out quickly. Are you going to keep gathering money or get out?

You escaped but got less money than you had hoped for. But at least you made it out alive.

You decided to keep collecting money. It wasn't worth it though, because when the cops arrived on the scene, they ordered you to drop the money and you refused. They then proceeded to shoot all of your friends, and you as well.

You and your friends decide that the best way to get in is to blow up the back door. You use ultra-quiet gunpowder so no one can hear and the minute you get in you disable to security cameras. Your plan seems to be going well. The question is where you guys should go from there. Do you want to go straight for the vault or play it safer and go to the teller counter?

You decide to play it safe and go to the teller counter to steal money. However, it's locked. The key is nowhere to be found and it is quite difficult to pick. By the time you pick the lock, the cops have arrived.

You decide to go to the vault. It has the most money and money is what you want. However, as you get to the entrance of the vault, you realize there is a password. You must enter the password correctly on the first try in order to enter the vault. What are you going to guess as the passcode?

You decide to guess 0000 as the code. Unfortunately, that is not the correct password. The alarm sounds, signaling that the password was incorrect and there is an intruder. The doors have locked so there is nothing you can do. The police are on their way.

You decide to guess your birthday as the code. Unfortunately, that is not the passcode. The alarm sounds signaling that the password was incorrect and there is an intruder. The doors have locked so there is nothing you can do. The police are on their way.

You decide to guess the banks address as the code and it works. You were successful! The vault opens and you are in! You guys gather all the money you can shove into your bags and decide to leave. You have successfully robbed the bank. You have all the money you will ever need and the police never find you. Successful night for you and your friends! Congrats!
